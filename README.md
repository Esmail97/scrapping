# scrapping
web scrapping using python 

The objective of this project is to collect data from Booking.com using web scraping techniques.
The main goal is to extract data related to hotels, including prices, ratings, reviews, amenities, and locations.
This data can be used in future to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior,
such as popular destinations, preferred amenities, and booking patterns.

BeautifulSoup (bs4) is used to extract information from HTML documents
requests is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis

To summarize, web scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup is a useful technique for extracting data from websites. 
In this project, I covered how to extract hotel data from Booking.com and create a CSV dataset from it.
